# 🐣 GodMode - the smol AI Chat Browser

This is a dedicated chat browser that only does one thing: help you quickly access **the full webapps** of ChatGPT, Claude 2, Perplexity, Bing and more **with a single keyboard shortcut (Cmd+Shift+G)**.

Whatever is typed at the bottom is entered into all **web apps** simultaneously, however if you wish to explore one further than the other you can do so independently since they are just webviews.

## Installation

Install [here](https://github.com/smol-ai/GodMode/releases/latest)! Arm64 for Apple Silicon Macs, non Arm64 for the rest (there are some [temporary issues for Intel Macs](https://github.com/smol-ai/GodMode/issues/163), but beta.0 works. help wanted!).

We [just added Windows/Linux support](https://github.com/smol-ai/GodMode/pull/162), but it needs a lot of work. Help wanted!

You can also build from source, see instructions below.

## Mixture of Mixture of Experts

It's well discussed by now that [GPT4 is a mixture of experts model](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1671272883379908608), which explains its great advancement over GPT3 while not sacrificing speed. It stands to reason that if you can run one chat and get results from all the top closed/open source models, you will get that much more diversity in results for what you seek. As a side benefit, we will add opt-in data submission soon so we can crowdsource statistics on win rates, niche advantages, and show them over time.

> “That's why it's always worth having a few philosophers around the place. One minute it's all is truth beauty and is beauty truth, and does a falling tree in the forest make a sound if there's no one there to hear it, and then just when you think they're going to start dribbling one of 'em says, incidentally, putting a thirty-foot parabolic reflector on a high place to shoot the rays of the sun at an enemy's ships would be a very interesting demonstration of optical principles.”

## Oh so this is like nat.dev?

Yes and no:

1. SOTA functionality is often released without API (eg: ChatGPT Code Interpreter, Bing Image Creator, Bard Multimodal Input, Claude Multifile Upload). **We insist on using webapps** so that you have full access to all functionality on launch day. We also made light/dark mode for each app, just for fun (`Cmd+Shift+L` (Aug update: currently broken in the GodMode rewrite, will fix))
2. This is a **secondary browser** that can be pulled up with a keyboard shortcut (`Cmd+Shift+G`, customizable). Feels a LOT faster than having it live in a browser window somewhere and is easy to pull up/dismiss during long generations.
3. Supports no-API models like Perplexity and Poe, and local models like LLaMa and Vicuna (via [OobaBooga](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui)).
4. No paywall, build from source.
5. Fancy new features like PromptCritic (AI assisted prompt improvement)

## Features and Usage

- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:

  - Use `Cmd+Shift+G` for quick open and `Cmd+Enter` to submit.
  - Customize these shortcuts (thanks [@davej](https://github.com/smol-ai/GodMode/pull/85)!):
    - Quick Open
      - ![image](https://github.com/davej/smol-ai-menubar/assets/6764957/3a6d0a16-7f54-43e5-9060-ec7b2486d32d)
    - Submit can be toggled to use `Enter` (faster for quick chat replies) vs `Cmd+Enter` (easier to enter multiline prompts)
  - `Cmd+Shift+L` to toggle light/dark mode (not customizable for now)
  - Remember you can customize further by building from source!

- **Pane Resizing and Rearranging**:

  - Resize the panes by clicking and dragging.
  - Use `Cmd+1/2/3` to pop out individual webviews
  - Use `Cmd +/-` to zoom in/out globally
  - open up the panel on the bottom right to reorder panes or reset them to default
  - `Cmd p` to pin/unpin the window Always on Top

- **Model Toggle**:

  - Enable/disable providers by accessing the context menu. The choice is saved for future sessions.
  - Supported models: ChatGPT, Bing, Bard, Claude 1/2, and more (see Supported LLM Providers above)

- **Support for oobabooga/text-generation-webui**:

  - Initial support for [oobabooga/text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) has been added.
  - Users need to follow the process outlined in the text-generation-webui repository, including downloading models (e.g. [LLaMa-13B-GGML](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/LLaMa-13B-GGML/blob/main/llama-13b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin)).
  - Run the model on `http://127.0.0.1:7860/` before running it inside of the smol GodMode browser.
  - The UI only supports one kind of prompt template. Contributions are welcome to make the templating customizable (see the Oobabooga.js provider).

- **Starting New Conversations**:

  - Use `Cmd+R` to start a new conversation with a simple window refresh.

- **Prompt Critic**: Uses Llama 2 to improve your prompting when you want it!

## Download and Setup

You can:

- download the precompiled binaries: https://github.com/smol-ai/GodMode/releases/latest (sometimes Apple/Windows marks these as untrusted/damaged, just open them up in Applications and right-click-open to run it).
  - for Macs, you can use the "-universal.dmg" versions and it will choose between Apple Silicon/Intel architectures. We recommend installing this, but just fyi:
    - Apple Silicon M1/M2 macs use the "arm64" version
    - Intel Macs use the ".dmg" versions with no "arm64"
  - for Windows, use ".exe" version. It will be marked as untrusted for now as we haven't done Windows codesigning yet
  - for Linux, use ".AppImage". We don't think we support Arch Linux yet.
- Or run it from source (instructions below)

When you first run the app:

1. log into your Google account (once you log into your google account for chatgpt, you'l also be logged in to Bard, Perplexity, Anthropic, etc).
2. For Bing, after you log in to your Microsoft account, you'll need to refresh to get into the Bing Chat screen. It's a little finnicky at first try but it works.

## seeking contributors!

please see https://github.com/smol-ai/GodMode/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

## build from source

If you want to build from source, you will need to clone the repo and open the project folder:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smol-ai/GodMode.git
   cd GodMode
   npm install --force
   # On Windows, you may also need Squirrel - these are old instructions, we would love a Windows volunteer to verify
   # npm install electron-squirrel-startup

   npm run start # to run in development, locally
   ```

2. Generate binaries:

   ```bash
   npm run package # https://electron-react-boilerplate.js.org/docs/packaging
   # ts-node scripts/clean.js dist clears the webpackPaths.distPath, webpackPaths.buildPath, webpackPaths.dllPath
   # npm run build outputs to /release/app/dist/main
   # electron-builder build --publish never builds and code signs the app.

   # this is mostly for swyx to publish the official codesigned and notarized releases
   ```

   The outputs will be located in the `/release/build` directory.

## Related project

I only later heard about https://github.com/sunner/ChatALL which is cool but I think defaulting to a menbuar/webview experience is better - you get to use full features like Code Interpreter and Claude 2 file upload when they come out, without waiting for API
