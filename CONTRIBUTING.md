# contributors guide

## seeking contributors!

this is a FOSS effort and will never be commercialized (no tracking, will not be a paid app (but the chat apps within might), etc). please check out the feature requests (https://github.com/smol-ai/GodMode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) if you'd like to help! in particular, we'd like:

- **a PR to make the 3 panels customizable to different URLs and input targets!**
- a "Windows maintainer" to handle Windows user needs and beta test every release to make sure we didn't break something for them

## Install and Run from Source

To install and run from source, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smol-ai/GodMode.git
   cd GodMode
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the application and generate the platform-specific desktop file:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

   This command will launch the application and automatically generate the appropriate desktop file or shortcut for your operating system (Linux, macOS, or Windows).

## debugging

I have the devtools up all the time while in development. You can disable them by commenting this line.

```js
window.webContents.openDevTools();
```

## building and notarizing

Apple is a piece of sht.

copy `.env.example` to `.env` and follow https://www.electronforge.io/guides/code-signing/code-signing-macos (we tried option 1, but eventually ended up with option 2 as you see below)

then you have to generate a bunch of stuff
https://medium.com/ascentic-technology/getting-an-electron-app-ready-for-macos-distribution-2941fce27450

```bash
$ spctl -a -vvv -t install smolmenubar.app
smolmenubar.app: accepted
source=Notarized Developer ID
origin=Developer ID Application: Shawn Wang (7SVH735GV7)
```

all of this has now been packaged into a script called `npm run buildAndSign`. Note that for now, this script ONLY runs on swyx's macbook air inside the terminal (and somehow NOT in vsocde, i dont know why). If you are experienced with electron signing and notarizing, please help us make this work for all contributors!

```bash
npm run buildAndSign

> smolmenubar@0.0.16 buildAndSign
> NODE_ENV=sign npm run make


> smolmenubar@0.0.16 make
> electron-forge make --arch arm64,x64

## publishing to app store

> NOTE: we havent actually gotten this working yet, i just straight up gave up

the below from https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-builds/upload-builds is something like what we want

```bash
xcrun altool --validate-app -f smolmenubar.app -t macos -u shawnthe1@gmail.com
```

but doesnt work

```bash
xcrun altool --validate-app -f smolmenubar.app --type macos -u shawnthe1@gmail.com
shawnthe1@gmail.com's password:
